    " This is the workbook for the \"End-to-End Data Analysis in Python\" workshop\n",

The classification report has the advantage of giving you a lot more information, and if (for example) one class is more important to get right than the others (say you're trying to zero in on non-functional wells, so finding those correctly is more important than getting the functional wells right).\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, the [sklearn docs](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.classification_report.html) on ``classification_report`` are, like all the sklearn docs, incredibly helpful.  For interpreting the various metrics, [this page](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.precision_recall_fscore_support.html) may also help.\n",

    "\n",
    "We're in the home stretch now.  When we decided to select the 100 best features, setting that number to 100 was kind of a hand-wavey decision.  Similarly, the ``RandomForestClassifier`` that we're using right now has all its parameters set to their default values, which might not be optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, a straightforward thing to do now is to try different values of ``k`` and any ``RandomForestClassifier`` parameters we want to tune (for the sake of concreteness, let's play with ``n_estimators`` and ``min_samples_split``).  Trying lots of values for each of these free parameters is tedious, and there can sometimes be interactions between the choices you make in one step and the optimal value for a downstream step.  In other words, to avoid local optima, you should try all the **combinations** of parameters, and not just vary them independently.  So if you want to try 5 different values each for ``k``, ``n_estimators`` and ``min_samples_split``, that means 5 x 5 x 5 = 125 different combinations to try.  Not something you want to do by hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "``GridSearchCV`` allows you to construct a grid of all the combinations of parameters, tries each combination, and then reports back the best combination/model.  "
